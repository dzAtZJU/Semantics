# Semantics
![CLOC](https://github.com/dzAtZJU/Semantics/workflows/CLOC/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

This is an experimental map app:
1. Allowing adding tags to places.
2. Starting from a place, the client side allows searching(the server side is not implemented yet) new places by requiring each of the tags attached to be better or no worse.
3. There is a Dictionary containing three words currently each of which has a comment format, enabling custom interpretation.
4. Allowing adding friends by universal link then seeing friendsâ€™ tagged places.

This experimental app reflects the scale and complexity I can handle currently.
